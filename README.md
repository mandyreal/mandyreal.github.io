# FEDN Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

Web App here :  http://mandyreal.github.io/build/

Project Goal: Develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. Then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## How to Use:

1. Open src/index.html

2. Default location in search bar is set to Singapore. To search for a new location in Google Maps, enter the name of the place in City/State format for US locations (Mountain View, CA) or
   town/city for non-US locations (e.g. Makati City, Philippines) or just the city name (e.g. Sydney) then press Enter or click the Search button.

3. If the location is found in Google Maps, a list of 'Popular Places' by Foursquare will be displayed on the list box. Each item in the list box will show
   the name and category of the place, its address, and Foursquare rating
   - To filter the list by name or category of the place, enter the filter text in the filter bar then press Enter or cick the Filter button
   - Click on each item on the list box to highlight it on the map
   - Hover/click on each the map marker to show more info about the location like its name, category, website (if available) and a helpful tip about that specific location
